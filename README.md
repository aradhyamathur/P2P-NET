P2P-NET is a general-purpose deep neural network which learns geometric transformations between point-based shape representations from two domains, e.g., meso-skeletons and surfaces, partial and complete scans, etc.
The architecture of the P2P-NET is that of a bi-directional point displacement network, which transforms a source point set to a target point set with the same cardinality, and vice versa, by applying point-wise displacement vectors learned from data. 
P2P-NET is trained on paired shapes from the source and target domains, but without relying on point-to-point correspondences between the source and target point sets...  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09263">more in the paper</a>].

### Usage

An example of training P2P-NET 
<br/>
(to learn transformations between point-based skeletons and point-based surfaces with the airplane dataset.)

	python -u run.py --mode=train  --train_hdf5='data_hdf5/airplane_train.hdf5'   --test_hdf5='data_hdf5/airplane_test.hdf5' --domain_A=skeleton --domain_B=surface  --gpu=0

Test the model:

	python -u run.py --mode=test  --train_hdf5='data_hdf5/airplane_train.hdf5'   --test_hdf5='data_hdf5/airplane_test.hdf5' --domain_A=skeleton --domain_B=surface  --gpu=0 --checkpoint='output_airplane_skeleton-surface/trained_models/epoch_200.ckpt'
